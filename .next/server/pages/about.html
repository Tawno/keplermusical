He then trained as a lecturer/music teacher specialising in guitar, bass &amp; keyboards and worked for the Bristol &amp; Bath education authorities.</p><p>The idea for a Concept Album, ‘Opera’, or Stage Musical, arose several years ago, initiated by lifelong passion for Astronomy &amp; The History of Science. But, with so many work-life commitments, it was very much put on the ‘back-burner’. Then when the pandemic struck, Nick found he had a lot more time at home, and so decided to just get on with it!</p><p>To quote Nick…. ” It’s been quite liberating without the constraints of having to try and write three-minute/four-chord commercial songs about relationships or ‘how I’m feeling’! Far more of a challenge, for me at least, has been to portray concepts such as Geometry, and a 17th Century Witch Trial, as song lyrics, while still recognising the need for a catchy melody and a good ‘hook’! I hope I’ve succeeded.”</p></div><div class="card undefined"><b>Acknowledgments and thanks:</b><p>The primary inspiration for this work has been Arthur Koestler’s “The Watershed”.
