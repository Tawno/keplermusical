CELESTIAL OBSERVATION WITH THE NAKED EYE<br/>

AND IN THE WEE SMALL HOURS OF THE MORNING<br/>
LET YOUR  MIND BE OVERCOME WITH A YEARNING<br/>
TO MEASURE THE DANCES OF NATURE<br/>
AND TO PONDER UPON THE SECRETS OF HER CREATION<br/>

Capricorn<br/>
JOHANNES WAS BORN<br/>
UNDER THE SIGN OF CAPRICORN<br/>
WITH EACH OF THE FIVE<br/>
PLANETS ALIGNED<br/>
IN GEMINI
<br/>
THE STORY WE TELL<br/>
IS OF A CHILDHOOD SPENT IN HELL<br/>
AND OF ONE MAN’S DREAM<br/>
OF FIGURING OUT<br/>
THE WORKINGS OF HEAVEN’S MACHINE<br/>
RECKESS-INCLINED<br/>
OF MYSTICAL MIND<br/>
AND A HEAD FOR INTERPRETING HOROSCOPE SIGNS<br/>
<br/>
EXPLORER OF NUMBERS, ANGLES AND TIMES<br/>
HIS FAMILY’S FORTUNES, THE REASONS THE RHYMES<br/>
<br/>
WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED<br/>
THIS BOY SO WEAK AND SELF-OBSESSED<br/>
<br/>
WOULD EVENTUALLY PROVE COPERNICUS TO BE LITERALLY TRUE ?</p></Card>
